hycohanz
========

hycohanz is an Open Source (BSD license) Python wrapper interface to the ANSYS HFSS Windows COM API, enabling you to control HFSS from Python.

Minimal Example
===============

.. sourcecode:: python

	import hycohanz as hfss

	[oAnsoftApp, oDesktop] = hfss.setup_interface()

	raw_input('Press "Enter" to quit HFSS.>')

	hfss.quit_application(oDesktop)


Installation
============

Your are assumed to have:

* Administrative priviledges on a desktop computer
* Installed 64-bit Windows operating system (7, Vista, or XP)
* Functioning installation of HFSS v.15, stock-configured and licensed
* Working knowledge of Python
* No prior Python installation (it's okay if you do though)
* Ability to download and install software from the internet
* Ability to unzip files to your computer
* Working knowledge of the Windows command shell
* Ability to install software on the computer

1. If you have not already done so, download and/or install the 64-bit versions of the following:

   - Python 2.7 (for instance, from http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi)
   - pywin32 (for instance, from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe/download)

2. Verify that Python starts correctly by launching the Windows command shell (cmd.exe) and typing the following at the command prompt. ::

    > C:\Python27\python

   The Python interpreter should start and present the following prompt after a few seconds:

    >>>

3. Verify that pywin32 installed correctly by typing the following at the Python prompt.

    >>> import win32com

   If an ImportError does not occur, then pywin32 is likely to have installed correctly.

4. Exit Python by pressing Ctrl+D.

5. Visit https://github.com/mradway/hycohanz and download the latest release of hycohanz as a zip file.  As of this writing, this is done by clicking the button labeled "ZIP".

6. Unzip the file to a convenient location on your computer

7. Open another Windows command shell.

8. Change to the directory where you unzipped hycohanz.

9. At the Windows command shell prompt, run::

    > C:\Python27\python setup.py install

10. Verify that hycohanz installed correctly by opening another python shell ::

    > C:\Python27\python

   and entering at the interpreter prompt

    >>> import hycohanz

   If an ImportError does not occur, then it is possible that hycohanz installed correctly.

11. Ensure that all instances of HFSS are closed.

12. From where you downloaded hycohanz, change to the examples directory ::

    > cd examples

   and run the example script ::

    > C:\Python27\python setup_interface_and_quit_application.py

   You should see HFSS open in the background.  Pressing "Enter" at the prompt will cause HFSS to exit.  If this happens without errors then hycohanz is installed correctly.
