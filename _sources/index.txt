hycohanz
========
hycohanz is an Open Source (BSD-licensed) Python wrapper interface toolbox for the ANSYS HFSS Windows COM API.  hycohanz simplifies control of HFSS from Python for RF, microwave, and antenna engineers.

Minimal Example
---------------
.. sourcecode:: python

	import hycohanz as hfss

	[oAnsoftApp, oDesktop] = hfss.setup_interface()

	raw_input('Press "Enter" to quit HFSS.>')

	hfss.quit_application(oDesktop)

	del oDesktop
	del oAnsoftApp

Dozens more examples_ are included in the examples directory of the source distribution.

Quick Install
-------------
Installation is easy if you already have HFSS, Python, and the pywin32 Python package:

1. Download the `.zip file`_ from Github.

.. _`.zip file`:  https://github.com/mradway/hycohanz/archive/devel.zip

2. Unzip to a convenient location.

3. At the Windows command shell prompt, run::

    > C:\Python27\python setup.py install

See :ref:`detailed-install` if you don't already have Python installed.

Problems, Bugs, Questions, and Feature Requests
-----------------------------------------------
These are currently handled via the hycohanz `bug tracker`_.

.. _`bug tracker`: https://github.com/mradway/hycohanz/issues

This bug tracker is useful if you 

- run into problems with installing or running hycohanz, 
- find a bug, 
- have a question,
- would like to see a feature implemented.

Features
--------
hycohanz provides convenience functions for the following:

- Starting, connecting to, and closing HFSS
- Creating design variables
- Manipulating HFSS expressions
- Creating 3D models using polylines, circles, rectangles, spheres, etc.
- Querying objects and groups of objects
- Object manipulation via unite, subtract, imprint, mirror, move, cut, paste, rotate, scale, sweep, etc.
- Assigning boundary conditions
- Manipulating projects and designs
- Creating analysis setups and frequency sweeps

Warning
-------
hycohanz is pre-alpha software and is in active development.  
The hycohanz function interfaces can be expected to change frequently, with little concern for backwards compatibility.
This situation is likely to resolve once the project reaches a more mature state.  
However, if today you require a stable, reliable, and correct function library for HFSS, unfortunately this library is probably not for you in its current form.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
:Q: Why not write scripts using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or JavaScript (JS)?
:A: I've found that programming in Python is generally much, much easier and more 
    powerful than in either of these languages.  Plus, I've generally found that 
    Visual Basic scripts run inside HFSS tend to break without useful error 
    messages, or worse, crash HFSS entirely.  hycohanz can also crash HFSS. But 
    when it does, the Python interpreter gives you a nice stack trace, allowing 
    you to determine what went wrong.

:Q: Why use Windows COM instead of .NET?
:A: As I understand it, the Visual Basic examples in the HFSS Scripting Guide 
    use Windows COM, so that's what I use.  If you're using IronPython, then 
    accessing .NET resources should be trivial.  However, I don't use IronPython 
    since I make extensive use in my daily work of numpy, scipy, matplotlib, 
    h5py, etc., and IronPython has had issues integrating with these tools 
    in the past.

:Q: Why not metaprogram VBA or JS?  Then I could use this library on Linux.
:A: That was my initial approach, because I wanted cross-platform capability.  
    Compared to the Windows COM approach, it's a lot more time-consuming, and 
    it has all of the drawbacks of the first question.

:Q: Why did you use Python instead of MATLAB?
:A: I'm a recent convert to Python, so I now use Python in my daily workflow 
    whenever it's convenient (that means about 99.9% of the time). Python 
    gives you keyword arguments, which helps keep the average length in characters 
    of a hycohanz function call to a minimum, while minimizing implementation 
    overhead compared to MATLAB.

:Q: Why not skip the HFSS interface entirely and directly emit a .hfss file?  Then 
    I could use this library on Linux.
:A: I've also considered this approach.  As you may know, .hfss files are 
    quasi-human-readable text files with a file format that could in principle be 
    reasonably parsed and emitted.  However, the expected implementation effort 
    would have been quite a bit higher than I wanted.  Not to mention that the format is not 
    (to my knowledge) static, nor is it publicly specified or documented.  Thus, an 
    implementation of this approach would be expected to be fragile, crash HFSS 
    frequently, and leave non-useful error messages.

Contributing
------------
Often one finds that this library is missing a wrapper for a particular 
function.  Fortunately it's often quite easy to add, usually taking 
only a few minutes.  Most of the time it's a quick modification of 
an existing function.  Many functions can be implemented in five 
lines of code or less.  If you do add a feature to the code, please 
consider contributing it back to this project.
